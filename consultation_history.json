It's good to note that there are no other concerning symptoms present.\n\nSince the situation is not alarming and your symptoms are mild, I recommend the following three-step treatment plan to help you feel better:\n\n1. Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids, like water, herbal teas, or broths. This can really help.\n2. Use a humidifier in your bedroom. This can ease your coughing and improve your sleep quality.\n3. You might consider over-the-counter medications, such as antihistamines or cough suppressants, to help relieve your symptoms.\n\nIf you don\u2019t see improvement in three days, please reach out to your doctor. I can provide guidance, but I cannot replace an in-person examination. How does this sound to you?",
